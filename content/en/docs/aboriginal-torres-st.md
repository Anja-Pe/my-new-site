Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and issues relating to them continue to attract much study. But frequently, often due to ethical concerns intrinsic to small population research compounded by the particular aspects relating to indigenous peoples, Datasets are not made available for secondary analysis. It is important to collect and preserve these fragmented research resources and to make them available for further research, under appropriate protocols, so as to reduce the response burden on Australian Indigenous communities while enabling informed analysis and commentary in areas of national priority.
